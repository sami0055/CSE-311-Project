       <i> Bangladesh is basically a developing country.</i> It is one of the best places to live in South Asia. Although the country is small in area, its population is much higher than other countries. The population of this small country is about 18 crores. Actually, Bangladesh is a riverine and agricultural country.  Most of the people here are farmers.  They lead a very easy and simple life. However, Bangladesh is a land of beauty.  There is no other country in the world as beautiful as Bangladesh. There are many historical places here. Cox's Bazar Sea Beach and Patuakhali's Kuakata are two of them. The Sundarbans, one of the largest mangrove forests in the world, is located in the south of the country and is home to the Royal Bengal Tiger. Above all, I am grateful to be born in a beautiful country like Bangladesh. So, I love my country very much.
